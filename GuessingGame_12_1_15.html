      <h1>Guessing Game about Nadia</h1>
      <p> This page is scripted to play a guessing game about Nadia.
        You will be asked to identify yourself and then will be asked
        three questions about Nadia.  It will let you know how you did
        and the correct answers.</p>
      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>Using java script the site will first prompt the user for their name as an input.  It stores that as a variable known as 'user'.
      The variable will log the user's input to the console for the developer to know and greet the user with
      their name(the stored user variable) and initiates the game using an alert.</p>
      <p>The questions are completed in a series of prompts from the user followed by alerts on whether their
        their responses are correct.   This is done by creating a variable known as 'tracker' and intially set to 0.
        The tracker value is logged to the console initially and after each question for error checking. Each
        question is handled as follows:
          <ol>
            <li> Prompt user for answer of question, converts it to all lowercase, and stores it as a response variable</li>
            <li> Logs user response variable to console</li>
            <li> Logs answer variable to console</li>
            <li> Using 'if/else' statements it checks to see if the answer variable and response variable match</li>
              <ol>
                <li>If they are equal to each other it increases the tracking variable by 1 and alerts the user that their response is correct.</li>
                <li>If they do not equal each other it moves to the else statement and alerts the user that their response is incorrect.</li>
              </ol>
            <li> Logs the tracker variable to the console to make sure it advances for correct answers and remains the same for incorrect</li>
          </ol>
        Each question has new answer and response variables in order(1,2,3).</p>
      <p>From here Benton told me I am writing too much, so the final area gives an alert using the tracker detailing how many they got right.
        A series of if else statements are used to check for if the variables don't match and alerts the use to correct answers</p>
